Modules to Build:
	Navigation Logic
	Color(Destination) Recognition
	Depth(Obstacle) Recognition
	
Navigation PseudoCode
	Identify destination
	Center on destination
	If obstacle between self and destination, turn minimum amount to navigate around obstacle
	Once past obstacle, reacquire destination
	Center on destination
	Loop
	
	
Notes on arrays output from example.m

    % D is depth matrix information
    % 32001 is max distance
    % smaller the number, the closer an object is
    % infinitely small distance approaches around 150 (a little below it)
    % matrix size is 240 x 320
    
    % I is image matrix information
    % size is 480 * 640
    % 0 is black
    % not sure what white is
